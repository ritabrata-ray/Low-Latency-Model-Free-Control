Comparison with adaptive safe control techniques.
Here, we compare our safe control technique with other state of the art safe control algorithms namely: 

Adaptive CBF, 
Robust Adaptive CBF, 
Robust Adaptive CBF with Set Membership Identification,
Convex Body Chasing for Robust Control, 
BAyesian Learning based Safety and Adaptation.

We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm remains safe at all times where as other algorithms are initially unsafe and gradually learn the safe control law.
